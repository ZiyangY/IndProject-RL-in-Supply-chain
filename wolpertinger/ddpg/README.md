This folder contains **stevenpjg's** code found [here](https://github.com/stevenpjg/ddpg-aigym). I don't own this code, and i use it under the MIT license, as the [author](https://github.com/stevenpjg) presented.


There are a few changes though:
* some files and subfolders are missing
* ddpg.py changed to agent.py which includes some other agents too
* maybe very slight changes to some other files
